# Midi-Preset-Box
An Arduino based MIDI Preset Box designed to increase the flexibility of the audio effect pedal, <a href="http://www.moogmusic.com/products/moogerfoogers/mf-104m-super-delay" target="_blank">MOOG MF-104m Super Delay</a>.

The MOOG MF-104m audio effect unit has an extremely wide range of functionality that left me wanting a way to store several presets and quickly switch beteween them without manually adjusting the interface. Fortunately, the unit offers a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) input. I built my own MIDI controller that offers 9 storable presets in order to extend the functionality of this unit, it is especially useful in a performance/on-stage setting.
